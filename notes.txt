will start with client
lookup common way to unit test

notes
separating out tokio
    have an IrcTransport trait
        both a driver and driven port? well a port in any case
        should it take and provide IrcMessages or bytes? will prob go with IrcMessage for ports-and-adapters testing reasons
            but have an easy to use and common serializer and deserializer for normal implementations to use
                writes are easy. just deserialize and write all the bytes to the buffered writer
                for reads, take a Buf and return a Result<Some<>>
                will get unit tested, since it's easy and otherwise gets no unit test coverage (but gets integration test coverage)


no common connection struct between daemon and client
    similar, but from a modeling perspective, they're different enough
    daemon has a User that keeps track of state and holds the IrcTransport
    client has Client that does the needful
